# Exercise Lab3: Network

ROOT = Path(__file__).parent.parent
INPUT_FOLDER = ROOT / 'resources'
file_input = INPUT_FOLDER / 'nodes.json'


# Load the Network from the JSON file, connect nodes and lines in Network.
# Then propagate a Signal Information object of 1mW in the network and save the results in a dataframe.
# Convert this dataframe in a csv file called 'weighted_path' and finally plot the network.
# Follow all the instructions in README.md file
